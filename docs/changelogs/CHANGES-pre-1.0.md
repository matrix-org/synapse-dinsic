Changes in synapse v0.30.0 (2018-05-24)
=======================================

\'Server Notices\' are a new feature introduced in Synapse 0.30. They provide a channel whereby server administrators can send messages to users on the server.

They are used as part of communication of the server policies (see `docs/consent_tracking.md`), however the intention is that they may also find a use for features such as \"Message of the day\".

This feature is specific to Synapse, but uses standard Matrix communication mechanisms, so should work with any Matrix client. For more details see `docs/server_notices.md`

Further Server Notices/Consent Tracking Support:

-   Allow overriding the server\_notices user\'s avatar (PR #3273)
-   Use the localpart in the consent uri (PR #3272)
-   Support for putting %(consent\_uri)s in messages (PR #3271)
-   Block attempts to send server notices to remote users (PR #3270)
-   Docs on consent bits (PR #3268)

Changes in synapse v0.30.0-rc1 (2018-05-23)
===========================================

Server Notices/Consent Tracking Support:

-   ConsentResource to gather policy consent from users (PR #3213)
-   Move RoomCreationHandler out of synapse.handlers.Handlers (PR #3225)
-   Infrastructure for a server notices room (PR #3232)
-   Send users a server notice about consent (PR #3236)
-   Reject attempts to send event before privacy consent is given (PR #3257)
-   Add a \'has\_consented\' template var to consent forms (PR #3262)
-   Fix dependency on jinja2 (PR #3263)

=======================================

Changes:

-   Update docker documentation (PR #3222)

Changes in synapse v0.29.0 (2018-05-16)
=======================================

Not changes since v0.29.0-rc1

Changes in synapse v0.29.0-rc1 (2018-05-14)
===========================================

Notable changes, a docker file for running Synapse (Thanks to @kaiyou!) and a closed spec bug in the Client Server API. Additionally further prep for Python 3 migration.

Potentially breaking change:

-   Make Client-Server API return 401 for invalid token (PR #3161).

    This changes the Client-server spec to return a 401 error code instead of 403 when the access token is unrecognised. This is the behaviour required by the specification, but some clients may be relying on the old, incorrect behaviour.

    Thanks to @NotAFile for fixing this.

Changes in synapse v0.28.1 (2018-05-01)
=======================================

SECURITY UPDATE

-   Clamp the allowed values of event depth received over federation to be \[0, 2\^63 - 1\]. This mitigates an attack where malicious events injected with depth = 2\^63 - 1 render rooms unusable. Depth is used to determine the cosmetic ordering of events within a room, and so the ordering of events in such a room will default to using stream\_ordering rather than depth (topological\_ordering).

    This is a temporary solution to mitigate abuse in the wild, whilst a long term solution is being implemented to improve how the depth parameter is used.

    Full details at <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I3fi2S-XnpO45qrpCsowZv8P8dHcNZ4fsBsbOW7KABI>

-   Pin Twisted to \<18.4 until we stop using the private \_OpenSSLECCurve API.

Changes in synapse v0.27.3-rc1 (2018-04-09)
===========================================

Notable changes include API support for joinability of groups. Also new metrics and phone home stats. Phone home stats include better visibility of system usage so we can tweak synpase to work better for all users rather than our own experience with matrix.org. Also, recording \'r30\' stat which is the measure we use to track overal growth of the Matrix ecosystem. It is defined as:-

Counts the number of native 30 day retained users, defined as:- \* Users who have created their accounts more than 30 days

:   -   Where last seen at most 30 days ago
    -   Where account creation and last\_seen are \> 30 days\"

Changes in synapse v0.27.0-rc1 (2018-03-14)
===========================================

The common case for running Synapse is not to run separate workers, but for those that do, be aware that synctl no longer starts the main synapse when using `-a` option with workers. A new worker file should be added with `worker_app: synapse.app.homeserver`.

This release also begins the process of renaming a number of the metrics reported to prometheus. See [docs/metrics-howto.rst](docs/metrics-howto.rst#block-and-response-metrics-renamed-for-0-27-0). Note that the v0.28.0 release will remove the deprecated metric names.

-   Add support for whitelisting 3PIDs that users can register. (PR #2813)
-   Add `/room/{id}/event/{id}` API (PR #2766)
-   Add an admin API to get all the media in a room (PR #2818) Thanks to @turt2live!

    -   `--enable-registration` - Enable registration for new users.

Application services:

-   Reliably retry sending of events from Synapse to application services, as per [Application Services](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/0c6bd9/specification/25_application_service_api.rst#home-server---application-service-api) spec.
-   Application services can no longer register via the `/register` API, instead their configuration should be saved to a file and listed in the synapse `app_service_config_files` config option. The AS configuration file has the same format as the old `/register` request. See [docs/application\_services.rst](docs/application_services.rst) for more information.

Changes in synapse v0.8.1 (2015-03-18)
======================================

-   Disable registration by default. New users can be added using the command `register_new_matrix_user` or by enabling registration in the config.
-   Add metrics to synapse. To enable metrics use config options `enable_metrics` and `metrics_port`.
-   Fix bug where banning only kicked the user.

Changes in synapse v0.8.0 (2015-03-06)
======================================

General:

-   Add support for registration fallback. This is a page hosted on the server which allows a user to register for an account, regardless of what client they are using (e.g. mobile devices).
-   Added new default push rules and made them configurable by clients:
    -   Suppress all notice messages.
    -   Notify when invited to a new room.
    -   Notify for messages that don\'t match any rule.
    -   Notify on incoming call.

Federation:

-   Added per host server side rate-limiting of incoming federation requests.
-   Added a `/get_missing_events/` API to federation to reduce number of `/events/` requests.

Configuration:

-   Added configuration option to disable registration: `disable_registration`.
-   Added configuration option to change soft limit of number of open file descriptors: `soft_file_limit`.
-   Make `tls_private_key_path` optional when running with `no_tls`.

Application services:

-   Application services can now poll on the CS API `/events` for their events, by providing their application service `access_token`.
-   Added exclusive namespace support to application services API.

Changes in synapse v0.7.1 (2015-02-19)
======================================

-   Initial alpha implementation of parts of the Application Services API. Including:
    -   AS Registration / Unregistration
    -   User Query API
    -   Room Alias Query API
    -   Push transport for receiving events.
    -   User/Alias namespace admin control
-   Add cache when fetching events from remote servers to stop repeatedly fetching events with bad signatures.
-   Respect the per remote server retry scheme when fetching both events and server keys to reduce the number of times we send requests to dead servers.
-   Inform remote servers when the local server fails to handle a received event.
-   Turn off python bytecode generation due to problems experienced when upgrading from previous versions.

Changes in synapse v0.7.0 (2015-02-12)
======================================

-   Add initial implementation of the query auth federation API, allowing servers to agree on whether an event should be allowed or rejected.
-   Persist events we have rejected from federation, fixing the bug where servers would keep requesting the same events.
-   Various federation performance improvements, including:
    -   Add in memory caches on queries such as:

        > -   Computing the state of a room at a point in time, used for authorization on federation requests.
        > -   Fetching events from the database.
        > -   User\'s room membership, used for authorizing presence updates.

    -   Upgraded JSON library to improve parsing and serialisation speeds.

-   Add default avatars to new user accounts using pydenticon library.
-   Correctly time out federation requests.
-   Retry federation requests against different servers.
-   Add support for push and push rules.
-   Add alpha versions of proposed new CSv2 APIs, including `/sync` API.

Changes in synapse 0.6.1 (2015-01-07)
=====================================

-   Major optimizations to improve performance of initial sync and event sending in large rooms (by up to 10x)

Changes in synapse 0.6.0 (2014-12-16)
=====================================

-   Add new API for media upload and download that supports thumbnailing.
-   Replicate media uploads over multiple homeservers so media is always served to clients from their local homeserver. This obsoletes the \--content-addr parameter and confusion over accessing content directly from remote homeservers.
-   Implement exponential backoff when retrying federation requests when sending to remote homeservers which are offline.
-   Implement typing notifications.
-   Fix bugs where we sent events with invalid signatures due to bugs where we incorrectly persisted events.

-   Fix potential memory leak.

Changes in synapse 0.5.3c (2014-12-02)
======================================

-   Change the default value for the content\_addr option to use the HTTP listener, as by default the HTTPS listener will be using a self-signed certificate.
