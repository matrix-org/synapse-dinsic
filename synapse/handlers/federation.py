        # N.B. this also increases our chances of falling back to
        # fetching fresh state for the room if the missing event
        # can't be found, which slightly reduces our security.
        # it may also increase our DAG extremity count for the room,
        # causing additional state resolution?  See #1760.
        # However, fetching state doesn't hold the linearizer lock

        # ----
        #
        # Update richvdh 2018/09/18: There are a number of problems with timing this
        # request out aggressively on the client side:
        #
        # - it plays badly with the server-side rate-limiter, which starts tarpitting you
        #   if you send too many requests at once, so you end up with the server carefully
        #   working through the backlog of your requests, which you have already timed
        #   out.
        #
        # - for this request in particular, we now (as of
        #   https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3456) reject any PDUs where the
        #   server can't produce a plausible-looking set of prev_events - so we becone
        #   much more likely to reject the event.
        #
        # - contrary to what it says above, we do *not* fall back to fetching fresh state
        #   for the room if get_missing_events times out. Rather, we give up processing
        #   the PDU whose prevs we are missing, which then makes it much more likely that
        #   we'll end up back here for the *next* PDU in the list, which exacerbates the
        #   problem.
        #
        # - the aggressive 10s timeout was introduced to deal with incoming federation
        #   requests taking 8 hours to process. It's not entirely clear why that was going
        #   on; certainly there were other issues causing traffic storms which are now
        #   resolved, and I think in any case we may be more sensible about our locking
        #   now. We're *certainly* more sensible about our logging.
        #
