        ## Ratelimiting ##

        # Ratelimiting settings for client actions (registration, login, messaging).
        #
        # Each ratelimiting configuration is made of two parameters:
        #   - per_second: number of requests a client can send per second.
        #   - burst_count: number of requests a client can send before being throttled.
        #
        # Synapse currently uses the following configurations:
        #   - one for messages that ratelimits sending based on the account the client
        #     is using
        #   - one for registration that ratelimits registration requests based on the
        #     client's IP address.
        #   - one for login that ratelimits login requests based on the client's IP
        #     address.
        #   - one for login that ratelimits login requests based on the account the
        #     client is attempting to log into.
        #   - one for login that ratelimits login requests based on the account the
        #     client is attempting to log into, based on the amount of failed login
        #     attempts for this account.
        #   - one that ratelimits third-party invites requests based on the account the
        #     that's making the requests.
        #
        # The defaults are as shown below.

        #   - sleep_limit: number of federation requests from a single server in
        #     a window before the server will delay processing the request.
        #   - sleep_delay: duration in milliseconds to delay processing events
        #     from remote servers by if they go over the sleep limit.
        #   - reject_limit: maximum number of concurrent federation requests
        #     allowed from a single server
        #   - concurrent: number of federation requests to concurrently process
        #     from a single server

        # The defaults are as shown below.
