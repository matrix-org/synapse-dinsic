# REQUIREMENTS is a simple list of requirement specifiers[1], and must be
# installed. It is passed to setup() as install_requires in setup.py.
#
# CONDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS is the optional dependencies, represented as a dict
# of lists. The dict key is the optional dependency name and can be passed to
# pip when installing. The list is a series of requirement specifiers[1] to be
# installed when that optional dependency requirement is specified. It is passed
# to setup() as extras_require in setup.py
#
# Note that these both represent runtime dependencies (and the versions
# installed are checked at runtime).
#
# Also note that we replicate these constraints in the Synapse Dockerfile while
# pre-installing dependencies. If these constraints are updated here, the same
# change should be made in the Dockerfile.
