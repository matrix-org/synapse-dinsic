# This file serves as a blacklist for SyTest tests that we expect will fail in
# Synapse. This doesn't include flakey tests---better to deflake them instead.
#
# Each line of this file is scanned by sytest during a run and if the line
# exactly matches the name of a test, it will be marked as "expected fail",
# meaning the test will still run, but failure will not mark the entire test
# suite as failing.
#
# Test names are encouraged to have a bug accompanied with them, serving as an
# explanation for why the test has been excluded.
